# Codex PLAN Review — PR CXT-4 (ContextPack prompt assembler)

DESIGN/PLAN review (code not written yet — judge the design). CXT-1/2/3 merged. Inspect
packages/core/src/disco/core/llm/routing.py (_inject_prompt), view.py (_recitation_message, _latest_plan),
and packages/core/src/disco/core/context/* to ground judgment. Return APPROVE|REVISE|BLOCKED_CODEX_UNAVAILABLE.

Judge specifically:
(a) Given routing._inject_prompt has NO event-log access and view.py already renders a goal/plan/todo
    recitation, is delivering CXT-4 as a PURE assembler+renderer now (build_context_pack/render_context_pack
    in loop/context_builder.py) with the live wiring + recitation-unification DEFERRED to CXT-7 the right
    call — or must CXT-4 wire into the live prompt now (risking C6-covered behavior with no integration
    harness yet)?
(b) Is taking `failures` as a caller-supplied arg (from the CXT-2 store/ledger) rather than heuristically
    mining AgentErrorEvents the correct, non-fragile choice?
(c) Is deriving goal←latest PlanEvent.summary / version←revision (head-user-message fallback) correct?
(d) Is render_context_pack's byte-stable determinism (for prompt-cache prefix reuse) + SourcePriority
    ordering + empty-section omission sound? Any false-affordance or redundancy risk vs the existing
    recitation block?
(e) Test sufficiency.

## PR Plan
## PR CXT-4 — ContextPack prompt assembler

### Status
PLANNING → CODEX_REVIEW

### Dependencies
- CXT-1 (ContextPack/ContextLedger/from_ledger), CXT-2 (store.reconstruct), CXT-3
  (resolved_ranges_from_events).

### Key seam findings (scout)
- The system prompt is injected in routing._inject_prompt, which has NO access to the event log — so the
  pack cannot be assembled there. Events live at the View/loop layer.
- A `<current-objective>` recitation block (view.py:_recitation_message, C6-cadence-gated) ALREADY renders
  goal + plan progress + next step into the model context. CXT-4 must NOT add a duplicate goal/todo block.
- No existing surfacing of unresolved verifier failures into context.

### Decision (scope) — pure assembler + renderer now, live wiring at CXT-7
Deliver the ASSEMBLER + RENDERER as pure, fully-tested mechanism (the thing the campaign names). DEFER the
behavior-flip (replacing raw history / unifying with the recitation block) to CXT-7 integration, where the
context-runtime integration tests live. Rationale: routing._inject_prompt lacks events; the live seam is
the ViewBuilder/recitation, and replacing it touches C6-covered behavior — high risk under no integration
harness yet. Same deferral pattern Codex APPROVED for CXT-1/2/3. Flagging for APPROVE/REVISE.

### Plan — packages/core/src/disco/core/loop/context_builder.py (NEW; the campaign names this file)
- `build_context_pack(events, *, base_ledger=None, policy=None, todo_text=None, failures=(),
   allowed_next_actions=()) -> ContextPack`:
  - start from base_ledger (a ContextLedger, e.g. from CXT-2 store.reconstruct of .disco/context files) or
    ContextLedger.empty("").
  - OVERLAY event-derived truth: active_goal ← latest PlanEvent.summary (fallback: head USER MessageEvent
    text); current_version ← latest PlanEvent.revision; resolved_ranges ← resolved_ranges_from_events(events);
    latest_verifier_failures ← `failures` arg (caller supplies from store/ledger — NOT heuristically mined,
    avoids a fragile event-scan); retained_refs ← base retained + each resolved range's summary_ref.
  - return ContextPack.from_ledger(merged_ledger, policy=policy, todo_text=todo_text,
    allowed_next_actions=allowed_next_actions).
- `render_context_pack(pack, priority=None) -> str`: a DETERMINISTIC, byte-stable `<context-pack>` block,
  sections ordered by SourcePriority.default(): goal, contract, version, todo, unresolved failures (compact
  one-line each), recoverable refs (paths only), allowed next actions. Empty sections omitted. Stable across
  turns when inputs unchanged (enables prompt-cache prefix reuse). No event history, no raw tool chatter.
- `_latest_plan(events)` helper (mirror view.py's, local) to read summary/revision without importing view.

### Scope boundaries (for the gate)
- PURE functions only; NO change to routing/_inject_prompt, ViewBuilder, or _recitation_message (so C6 tests
  + live behavior are untouched). CXT-7 wires build/render into the actual prompt + decides the
  recitation-unification / history-replacement.
- failures supplied by caller (store/ledger) — not mined from events here (fragile + duplicates CXT-2).

### Tests (packages/core/tests/test_context_pack_prompt.py)
- build_context_pack overlays goal+version from the latest PlanEvent (and head-user-message fallback when
  no plan); folds resolved-range summary_refs into recoverable_refs.
- failures arg surfaces as latest_failures (unresolved only — resolved excluded by from_ledger).
- render_context_pack: included-once (single `<context-pack>` block); deterministic/byte-stable across two
  calls with identical input; sections appear in SourcePriority order; empty sections omitted; NO raw event
  history present; a resolved-range summary path appears under recoverable refs.
- policy caps respected in the rendered refs (reuses from_ledger capping).
